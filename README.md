# GeckoSounds 1.0.0.0
Download it and play some gecko sounds. And if you want to add some own sounds? Do it. Written in C# (WFA-Forms).

Hey,

if you want to add your own sounds, do this steps first

This steps could be made in the software itself. Open GeckoSounds then click on Menu > Sound Data. There you can open up the sound folder 
and i've put a link for an audio converter, too. 

First click on the link (.wav Audio Converter) then the browser will shown up. Select your sounds data and convert it to .wav, then 
save it in the sounds folder. There must be some other files like "1.wav", "2.wav"... 

1.wav is mapped on the button 'Sound 1';
2.wav is mapped on the button 'Sound 2';
3...

The buttons Sound 6 - 8 are not mapped at the beginning. There for some custom sounds from you.
Because of that please name your first sounds to 6.wav, 7.wav or 8.wav.
